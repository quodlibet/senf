**Senf** introduces a new platform native string type called `fsnative`. It
adds functions to convert text, bytes and paths to and from that new type and
helper functions to integrate it nicely with the Python stdlib.

**Senf** supports Python 2.7, 3.4+, works with PyPy, works on Linux, Windows,
macOS, is MIT licensed, and only depends on the stdlib. It does not monkey
patch anything in the stdlib.
